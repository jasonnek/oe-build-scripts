oe-build-scripts
================

This is a set of build scripts that I use to build OE images.
There are a number of branches, each of which is specialized to build a specific project / image.
The 'master' branch is a simple template that builds a 'distro-less' generic core-image-minimal.
It also contains the infrastructure common to other projects like scripts to pull in additonal meta layers but it doesn't these facilities itself (see LAYERS).
